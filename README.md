# Image Processing Basics - IUTCVC

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Introduction to image processing** repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that introduces fundamental concepts of image processing. The notebook is designed to help students get started with essential techniques and methods used in computer vision.

This project was created for the **IUTCVC** (Isfahan University of Technology Computer Vision Cup) to provide a solid foundation for participants.

## Contents
The Jupyter Notebook covers the following topics:

- **Pixel Concept** - Understanding the basic unit of digital images
- **Flip and Rotation** - Transforming images by flipping and rotating
- **Color Channels** - Extracting and manipulating RGB channels
- **Grayscale Images** - Converting images to grayscale
- **Negative Images** - Creating negative versions of images
- **Image Stitching** - Merging multiple images into one
- **Image Resizing** - Scaling images up or down
- **Adding Images and Watermarking** - Overlaying images and embedding watermarks
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** - Evaluating image quality
- **Image Formats** - Understanding different file formats and their characteristics
